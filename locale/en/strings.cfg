[entity-description]
acid-rocket=A deadly rocket that releases an explosion of acid in all directions. Use with care.
crude-rocket=A crude rocket made from grenades and iron plates.
poison-rocket=A rocket with a poison gas filled warhead. Due to a rockets size, the cloud released is much smaller and has less duration.
basic-rocket-turret=A very basic rocket turret with layman guidance that limits it's range.
advanced-rocket-turret=A much more advanced rocket turret with improved range and damage.
nuclear-turret=Heavy rocket artillery piece with a massive range but weak structure. Capable of Atomic Bomb launching with lowered risk to user death.

[technology-description]
acid-rockets=Sulfuric acid and a thickening agent become a deadly goop when poured into a warhead.
crude-rockets=Crude rockets made from grenades and left over iron plates. Effective.
hybrid-rockets=Experimentation into different rocket warhead types.
poison-rockets=Poison Capsule tinkering leads to an effective poison rocket that disperses a smaller but still lethal poison cloud.
